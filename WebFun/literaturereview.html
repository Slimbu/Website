            <h1 class="title">Mitigation personal information exposure on the web</h1>
            <h2 class="sub-head">Introduction</h2>
            <p>In this review, I am going to write about how mitigation of personal information exposure on the
      web has changed over the decade. Just about half of the world’s population all over the world
      h​ave access to internet and are using the internet for their basic use, such as using Facebook for
      keeping in touch with people, browsing through web and to look for information or to do online
      shopping.(Internetlivestats, 2016)shows live internet users across the world.​ This means that we
      are being more exposed to internet more than ever.

              <h1 class="sub-head">Privacy</h1>
              <p>There ​ are studies suggesting that you should be careful before giving out your personal
                information to any website. There were multiple authors such as ​ (Dykstra-Erickson, Tscheligi, &
               SIGCHI, 2004, p. 471), (Vogelsang & Compaine, 2000, p. 47) both of their studies showed how
               users were concerned about their privacy when going online in the early 1990s​ . This used to
               concern a lot of online users which is why it is important for the users to know that it’s not a good
               choice to give out personal information to an unknown site which does not have any history or
                       being backed up by the government before giving out your private detail “Privacy has recently
                       become a prominent issue in the context of electronic commerce websites.Increasingly, privacy policies
                       posted on such websites are receiving considerable attention from the government and
                       consumers.”​

                       However, Bobbie Johnson a freelance journalist who wrote a article for the guardian about
                       technology and culture which talks about Facebook and where he claims that Mark Zuckerberg
                       the founder of Facebook during his interview said “people have really gotten comfortable sharing
                       their information in different kinds, but more openly and with more people” (2010, para. 3) to
                       him. (​ Reports, 2012)​ which is backed up by o​ther study which revealing that there were 28% of
                       people who were more open about their personal information where they shared everything in
                       public other than their friends from their list.

                <p>Although Facebook doesn’t share any information from the user but it does collect information
                         from the user depending on what sort of site of application the user uses and the information
                         that’s been gathered could be transferred to the third party without any knowledge of the user
                         even though there are restrictions to the Facebook application.
                         Facebook claims using ​ “ Cookies help them to provide, protect and improve the Facebook Services​ ” which in return uses to track
                         the user so that it can make things easier for the user to access.
                </p>
                <p>
                         Facebook will also keep in track of the site that user visits or the site user has visited that has a like button. One of the study by
                         (“Proceedings of the 2011 ACM SIGCOMM conference on Internet measurement conference -
                         IMC ’11,” 2011) ​ found out that most of the Facebook users doesn’t know anything about the
                         privacy setting​ they can have and led to identity theft. Study done by (Krishnamurthy & Wills,
                         2010) show that the growth of identity theft has increased on online social media. For their studythey used 12 online social
                         network and found out that there were some sort of data leakage that
                         could potentially identify a specific individual which involved transmission of online social
                         network identifier to third party servers through external applications.

              <h1 class="sub-head">Wireless Networking Security</h1>
              <p>(Heimlicher, Nuggehalli, & May, 2007, p. 59) The network technology and understanding of the
                          internet ever since early 1980s has become better. ​ Galbraith, M. (2013, p. 1365) says ​ recently
                          people have been storing their information electronically which is increasing concerns for the
                          data privacy and the security and how they have become vulnerable to theft and exposure to
                          hacking. According to (Pfleeger & Pfleeger, 2002, pp. 56–57)​ ​ recently wireless networking has
                          become very popular and with wireless networking it doesn’t have to be connected to a wired
                          connection but needs to be within the range of the wireless network. The wireless network uses
                          radio waves for communication.
              </p>
              <p>(Arbaugh, 2003, p. 99) on his article states “The standard 802.11 has been receiving a lot of
                          negative attention for few years” and talks about how there are reports suggesting networks are
                          being exploited as their weakness is being publicized and the tools that are being used for
                          breaking into is open source which could be downloaded from the internet service provider by
                          just paying $30 a month.(Kothari, Mahajan, Millstein, Govindan, & Musuvathi, 2011) studies
                          shows that the Hop-by-hop security is an important factor in wireless networking because
                          attackers can manipulate the protocols so that they can become one of the participants.(Kothari,
                          Mahajan, Millstein, Govindan, & Musuvathi, 2011) developed a method that could help them
                          discover the manipulation attacks inside the protocol which is - “By sending unexpected or
                          malformed messages that exploit bugs or inadequate defences in the protocol implementation,
                          adversaries can crash or hijack victims.”
              </P>
              <p >After spending some time studying led them to have a
                          good understanding of such attacks which led them to develop general tools and techniques that
                          could detect and mitigate them. Their goal during the manipulation attack was not just to crash or
                          hijack the participant, instead it was to induce other behaviours the adversaries or harm the
                          participant. (Savage, Wetherall, Karlin, & Anderson, 2001) explains how an attack may consists
                          of packets that are from different machines and are in control by the attacker. More importantly
                          the main attacker could conceal identity through using a number of computers. Both authors
                          (Kothari, Mahajan, Millstein, Govindan, & Musuvathi, 2011), (Savage, Wetherall, Karlin, &
                          Anderson, 2001) came to a conclusion that it would be difficult to address the problem because
                          it’s difficult to trace the main attacker as they disguise themselves by using false internet protocol
                          or spoofing. (DuPaul, 2016)​ ​ Spoofing that creates a false internet protocol that can be used in
                          attacking which can let the attacker stay anonymous. All these packets will go through the
                          internet without knowing the true origin.
